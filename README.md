# tree_visualizer-ft_container-
You just have to INCLUDE this file INSIDE your map class
> It will add the `print_tree()` function membre
 Just don't forget to change every `#define` at the top of the file to match your variables name with my code.
 You need at least :
 - a root (element at the top of your tree)
 - a structure or class for your nodes which contain
   - a value
   - a bool variable for the color (for RBT)
